# Parallel programming in Java (Rice University)

 • Theory of parallelism: computation graphs, work, span, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, Amdahl's Law, data races, and determinism

 • Task parallelism using Java’s ForkJoin framework

 • Functional parallelism using Java’s Future and Stream frameworks

 • Loop-level parallelism with extensions for barriers and iteration grouping (chunking)

 • Dataflow parallelism using the Phaser framework and data-driven tasks
